* [ MongoDB ] - Cross-platform document-oriented database program
* [ Socket. io ] - JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers
* [ jQuary ] - JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax
* [ Axios ] - Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript which can be used in your front-end application and in your Node.js backend.
* [ Json Web Token ] - Compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object
